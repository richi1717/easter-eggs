### Installation

```javascript
$ yarn add @richi1717/easter-eggs
```

Then inside of your client entry point (E.G. `index.js`, `main.js`, `app.js`),  
add `import '@richi1717/easter-eggs';`, that's it!

Now whenever someone enters the code in your app it will (I believe) an entertaining thing  
happen. Don't worry, I added cleanup so it will remove itself from your app once the animation is over.

### Available Codes

Currently the only available code is the [konami code](https://contra.fandom.com/wiki/Konami_Code) but I plan to add more later.

Konami: (`Start` would actually just be return/enter instead)

### Enjoy

This was written to mainly enter into the world of open source and npm. 
I've always thought this would be a fun project to do even though it's "silly". 
People used to hold the 80s and 90s easter eggs in such high esteem and nostalgia 
and I wanted to give an easy way to honor that. In the future I'll add more codes
 and a way to add your own images or gifs. My next addition is adding sonic since
  that's the code I have remembered all these years from the original Sonic.
